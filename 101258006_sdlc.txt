DevOps engineering assumes a critical role in the realm of contemporary software development, serving as a key catalyst for promoting collaborative efficiency throughout the software development lifecycle.
To begin, it expedites the release cycle of software by implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
This accelerates development processes, enabling teams to rapidly introduce updates and features, promptly meeting customer demands and maintaining a competitive edge in the market.
