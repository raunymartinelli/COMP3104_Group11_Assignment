# Repository Structure and Instructions for COMP3104_Group11_Assignment

## Branch Organization

# 1. main: 
#    - The 'main' branch contains the stable version of the project.
#    - Only thoroughly tested and reviewed code should be merged into 'main'.

# 2. 101333371-RaunyMartinelli:
#    - This branch is likely a feature, bugfix, or individual work branch derived from 'main'.
#    - Work specific to the tasks or features assigned to RaunyMartinelli is expected to be here.
#    - After code in this branch is tested and reviewed, it may be merged into 'main'.

# Additional branches may exist for other features, developers, or releases.

## Basic Git Workflow

# A. Cloning the Repository
#    - To work on the project, first, clone the repository to your local machine.
# Usage: git clone [Repository-URL]

# B. Working on a Feature/Branch
#    - Always create/checkout to a new branch for a new feature or bugfix, never work directly on 'main'.
# Usage: git checkout -b [New-Branch-Name]

# C. Pushing Changes
#    - Regularly commit and push your changes to the remote repository.
# Usage: 
#    git add [File-Name]
#    git commit -m "[Your Commit Message]"
#    git push origin [Your-Branch-Name]

# D. Merging Changes to 'main'
#    - Ensure your feature is working as expected and all code is reviewed before merging to 'main'.
#    - Typically, a pull request is created for the merge to allow team members to review.
#    - After review and successful CI/CD checks, the branch can be merged into 'main'.

# Note: Ensure to frequently synchronize your feature branch with 'main' to avoid large merge conflicts.

## Directory Structure

# At the root of the repository, we have:
# - README.md: This file provides an overview and documentation for the project.
# - .idea/: This directory likely contains configuration files related to the IDE being used.
# - [Other-Directories-and-Files]: Other necessary directories and files for the project.

# Note: Always keep your repository organized with well-named files and directories, and ensure to document them in README.md.

## Additional Notes

# - Always communicate with your team regarding the changes you're making to avoid conflicts.
# - Adhere to the coding standards and practices agreed upon by the team.
# - Ensure to thoroughly test your code before pushing to avoid breaking the existing stable versions.
