The Software Developement Life Cycle, more commonly referered to as SDLC. Is the process
for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.

The SDLC concept applies to a wide varity of hardware and software configurations, as a 
system can be composed of hardware only, software only, or a combination of both.

In the software development life cycle there's typically six stages: Analysis, design, 
development, and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation.
