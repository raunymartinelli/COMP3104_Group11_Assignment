DevOps is the methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of partices and tools,
Devops integrates and automates the work of software developent, and It operations as a means of improving
and shortening the system development life cycle.

The importance of Devops couln't be understated. It is indeed a methodology that can help out with any
sdlc for a software project.

Reasons that devops is really useful in the modern age
------------------------------------------------------

* It allows for faster development and deployment by automating various stages of SDLC. Continuous 
Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines help in automating testing, building, 
and deployment, reducing manual errors and speeding up the release cycle.

* Improved Collaboration which fosters collaboration between development and operations teams, breaking 
down silos that often exist in traditional SDLC approaches. This collaboration ensures that code is 
developed with operational considerations in mind, leading to more reliable and maintainable software.

* Allows for more flexibility in responding to changes requirements or market conditions.
Continuous Deployment(CD) enables rapid delivery of new features and updates, helping binuesses 
stay competitive.

* Helps with Risk Reduction by automating repetitive tasks and enforcing consistent deployment processes,
Devops reduces the risk associated with human errors during manual deplooyments. This results in a more
stable and predictable software release process.

* Devops encourages a customer-centric approach by enabling faster feedback from users. This feedback loop
allows development teams to iterate and improve the product more rapidly, aligning it better with the
customer needs.

* DevSecOps, an extension of DevOps, integrates security practices into SDLC from the outset. This helps
identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities early in the development process, reducing security risks.

* Through automation and improved resouce utilization, DevOps can lead to cost saving in the long run. It
reduces the need for manual, time-consuming tasks and minimizes infrastructure waste.

So, in conclusion. Devops is a key component in SDLC becasuse it accelerates development, improve collaboration,
ennhances quality, and makes the entire process more efficient and customer-focused. By integrating DevOps practices
into the SDLC, Organizations can stay competitive, reduce risk, and deliver high-quality software more rapidly.
